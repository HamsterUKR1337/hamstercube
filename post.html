            this is the most advanced 3x3 cube among professional speed puzzles!
            From incredibly cool packaging and accessories to state-of-the-art
            puzzle design know-how. So, the new version of the flagship cube GAN
            14 M Pro has few changes. The manufacturer has improved the anti-pop
            system, which makes the cube more resistant to flying elements, and
            the mechanism may also have been improved a little. The covers of
            the central elements have been changed, now it is better to use a
            special tool to open them.
