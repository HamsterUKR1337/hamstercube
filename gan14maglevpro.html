          <p>
            Enhanced Precision and Stability - The GAN14 Pro takes performance
            to a new level, evolving from its predecessor with refined edge
            pieces for superior stability and flawless corner alignment. Its
            advanced center-locking technology prevents popping, while an
            extended center cap latch ensures secure positioning. With a simple
            one-touch lid opening tool, adjustments are easier and smoother than
            ever. <br />
            Consistent, Controlled Feel - Featuring Enhanced Core Positioning
            4.0, the GAN14 Pro’s axis structure provides uniform force
            distribution through its magnetic core, achieving an unmatched
            balance of stability and control. With 1296 configurations, each
            twist can be tailored to the perfect hand feel. <br />
            Magnetic Levitation Technology - This cube is equipped with an
            advanced magnetic suspension system, offering 12 customizable magnet
            settings between the corners and core. Thanks to magnetic repulsion,
            the GAN14 Maglev cube can auto-align within 15-40 degrees of a
            completed turn, virtually eliminating friction for a near-levitating
            experience. <br />
            Precision Tuning with Dual Adjustment - Easily fine-tune your cube
            with the magnetic GES v3, which provides 6 tension and 6 center
            travel options. This dual numerical system allows you to craft a
            cubing experience that’s entirely your own, offering a wide range of
            possibilities in one compact design. <br />
            A Trusted Name in Cubing - Choosing GAN means joining a legacy of
            excellence in the speed cube world. Stay updated on the latest
            products, connect with fans, and share your thoughts on future
